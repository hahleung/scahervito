//A squared string has n lines, each substring being n characters long: For example:
//
//s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop" is a squared string of size 4.
//
//We will use squared strings to code and decode texts. To make things easier we suppose that our original text doesn't include the character '\n'.
//
//#Coding Input:
//
//a text t of length l.
//Consider the smallest integer n such that n * n be greater or equal to l.
//Complete t with the char of ascii code 11 (we suppose that this char is not in our original text) until the length of t is n * n.
//From now on we can transform the new t in a squared string s of size n by inserting '\n' where needed.
//Apply a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to s: that's it for the coding part.
//#Decoding Input:
//
//a squared string s resulting from the coding
//Apply a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to s
//Do some cleaning to have the original text t
//You can see clockwise rotation of 90 degrees: http://www.codewars.com/kata/56dbeec613c2f63be4000be6 You can see counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees: http://www.codewars.com/kata/56dbf59b0a10feb08c000227
//
//Example:
//
//t = "I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock"
//
//code(t) -> "c.nhsoI\nltiahi.\noentinw\ncng.nga\nk..mg.s\n\voao.f.\n\v'trtig"
//
//decode(code(t)) == "I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock"
//
//(Dots indicate spaces since they are quite invisible).
//
//Notes:
//Swift : character 11 is replaced by "\u{F7}" (ie "รท" - alt 246 -)
//Ocaml : character 11 is replaced by '&'
//Fortran: Your returned string for both functions are not permitted to contain redundant leading/trailing whitespace. In return, you may safely assume that all input strings passed into your function(s) will not contain redundant leading/trailing whitespace, i.e. you do not and should not trim the input string before operating on it
//Don't use this coding to keep your secrets:-)
